    <h2>1. Kubernetes</h2>
    <i>Edited by Meshu Deb Nath, Diwakar Dangal</i>
    <p>
        In the last 5 years, Kubernetes has become the most popular orchestration platform.
        It provides high availability and scalability through diverse self-healing and scaling
        mechanisms. Therefore, a huge community rise of this open-source project makes it the most
        popular orchestration platform right now. Kubernetes makes it easy to deploy and automatically
        manage a microservice-based complex application.

    </p>
    <p>
        In this report, we are going to discuss Kubernetes and its architecture.
        we will demonstrate a microservice deployment in the Kubernetes cluster and discuss the horizontal
        pod autoscaling (HPA) <a href="#r1">[1]</a>, the most important features of Kubernetes.

    <h2> 2. Container Technology </h2>
    <i>Edited by Diwakar Dangal</i>
    <p>
        Containers are the one which shares the properties of the operating system. They are
        Loosely coupled, distributed and independent to each other, therefore,
        which can be deployed and managed dynamically by the smaller teams which result in flexibility
        and effectiveness in every aspect of the entire process <a href="#r1">[1, </a><a href="#r13"> 13,</a><a
            href="#r14"> 14]</a>.
    <p>In a nutshell container
        technology is treated as one of the best practices for medium and large-scale
        industries because of its ability to make maximum use of the resources available <a href="#r1">[1]</a>.
    </p>
    <h3> 2.1. Container Orchestration </h3>

    <p>
        Container orchestration is a set of actions undertaken by application owners for selecting, deploying,
        monitoring and controlling the different configuration of operating resources to guarantee in the quality of
        services <a href="#r14">[14]</a>. Container technology gives rise to the birth of a new methodology called container orchestration.
        While handling different applications, continuous monitoring can be harsh. Also, the allocation of containers and solving
        pods could be a hectic job. So, Automation technology provides self-healing process, distribution of cut-off resources
        and auto-generating of the services.
    </p>
    <p>
        Container orchestration not only helps in the first step of development of the application, but it also manages the life
        cycles of containers throughout the process especially in large, dynamic environments <a href="#r25">[25]</a>.
        Processes that orchestrations generally control and automate, for example, scaling, allocating the resources, load
        balancing and traffic routing, monitoring the container health, configuring and scheduling of the process,
        making the interaction between containers secure.
    </p>

    <h3>2.2. When to use a plain docker, when Kubernetes, when none of them?
    </h3>
    <i>Edited by Meshu Deb Nath, Diwakar Dangal</i>

    <p>
        Docker <a href="#r22">[22]</a> and Kubernetes <a href="#r1">[1]</a> are not alternative technology to the
        other.
        Docker is a software that is used for containerized applications <a href="#r22">[22]</a>.
        Containerization is a technique of running an application so that the application can be
        isolated from the system. It can create an illusion for the application that it has working
        on its OS instances. Hence, Docker prepares to run, create and manage containers on a single OS.

    </p>
    <p>
        Kubernetes automates the process of scaling, updating, maintaining,
        and sorting containers. While Docker enables us to have containers in the first place.
        On the other side, Docker or Kubernetes will be an inadequate choice when the hardware
        resources are limited <a href="#r1">[1, </a><a href="#r22">22]</a>.

    </p>
    <h3>2.3 What are alternatives to Kubernetes?</h3>
    <i>Edited by Diwakar Dangal</i>
    <p>
        Kubernetes <a href="#r1">[1], </a> Docker swarm <a href="#r22">[22]</a>, and Mesos <a href="#r23">[23]</a>
        all of these technologies belong to the class of Dev Ops 3 layers: resource management, scheduling, and
        service management <a href="#r18">[18]</a>. Based on resource management availability such as memory, CPU,
        GPU, disk space, etcMesos has a greater functionality <a href="#r18">[18]</a>.

    </p>
    <p>
        Based on the schedule layer comparison Kubernetes performs better in all of this resources like placement,
        replication, scaling, readiness checking, resurrection, rescheduling, rolling deployment, and co-location <a
            href="#r18">[18]</a>. Based on the service management layer comparison Kubernetes and Mesos are in
        equivalent labels while here, Kubernetes have partial levels of dependencies and Mesos has less
        effectiveness in load balancing <a href="#r18">[18]</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Apart from the comparison between these technologies application owner, Docker swarm <a href="#r22">[22]</a>
        is easy to organize and set up, with a flexible API but has limited customization.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mesos are best for systems that have large and complex architecture and are also designed for maximum
        redundancy. It is a stable platform, however overly complex for small-scale systems that operate between
        10-20 nodes.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, in a nutshell, it depends on the company structure and working methodology for choosing the orchestration
        technique for them.

    <h2>3. Kubernetes </h2>
    <i>Edited by Diwakar Dangal</i>

    <p>
        Containers bundle up the application of user choice in the real-time environment, there could be thousands
        of containers.
        It can be a hectic job to monitor them and perform designated solutions accordingly. Now, here Kubernetes
        comes to the rescue,
        it provides an automated environment and handles a framework to run distributed systems silently in the
        background.
        Kubernetes can detect the failed application and provides deployment patterns accordingly <a href="#r1">[1]</a>.
        For example,
        if some container goes down it will start a new container and can easily manage a canary deployment
        throughout the process <a href="#r1">[1]</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        What's the specialities of Kubernetes and why user needs to use it.
    <ul>
        <li>
            Containers have their DNS name and IP address. Here in the condition if traffic to the container gets
            high,
            it balances the load and distributes
            the network traffic which makes deployment stable <a href="#r1">[1]</a>. So, service discovery and load
            balancing can be achieved.
        </li>
        <li>
            Kubernetes provides storage orchestration which automatically allows mounting storage of user choice, for example,
            local storage, public clouds, and many more <a href="#r1">[1]</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Automated rollout and rollbacks are possible because it gives a flexible environment to create new
            containers, remove existing or modify them in the desired state of the application owner<a
                href="#r1">[1]</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Automatic bin packing can be done by giving instruction to Kubernetes on how much CPU and memory(RAM)
            could
            be used according to process and container needs for utilizing the resources<a href="#r1">[1]</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Restarting the container which fails, replacing or killing non-functioning containers according to
            user-defined instruction and cannot participate until they are ready to serve <a href="#r1">[1]</a>.
            Hence, there is a self-healing in Kubernetes.
        </li>
        <li>
            It can store and manage confidential data i.e password, OAuth token, and SSH keys <a href="#r1">[1]</a>.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In a nutshell, secret and configuration management is possible and because of these many features,
        Kubernetes becomes the most popular orchestration tool for the enterprise-scale industry in these current
        circumstances.

    <h3>3.1 Kubernetes Components</h3>
    <i>Edited by Diwakar Dangal</i>

    <p>
        This section described the main components of a Kubernetes cluster and their interconnection between
        them.
    </p>

    <h4>3.1.1 Pod</h4>
    <p>
        The most basic execution and element in Kubernetes is a pod, which consists of multiple containers and
        deployment instructions for their execution <a href="#r2">[2]</a>. Each pod represents a single instance for
        the process and necessary execution guidelines to be carried out throughout the process and always belongs
        to a specific namespace <a href="#r2">[2]</a>. In this sense, it is referred to as a replica, hence during
        the process of deployment of an application,
        the desired number of replicas and amount of requested resources need to be specified in the YAML file of
        the application <a href="#r2">[2]</a>.

    </p>
    <p>
        Moreover, each pod is assigned with a unique IP address which allows an application to scale up for the
        instance. When the application requires more instances instead of adjusting new one can be created in the
        available pod to share the load of applications <a href="#r2">[2]</a>.
    </p>

    <h4>3.1.2 Service</h4>
    <p>
        It has a permanent IP address in the cluster, it can be attached to every node, if the pod dies in the
        process it remembers the current state of the pod when the new pod is formed, the operation begins from the
        previous state where it had died <a href="#r1">[1, </a><a href="#r2"> 2]</a>. Hence, when the pod dies
        service remains alive.
    </p>

    <h4>3.1.3 Ingress</h4>
    <p>
        It provides load-balancing, SSL-termination and virtual hosting for the Kubernetes cluster <a
            href="#r1">[1]</a>.
    </p>

    <h4>3.1.4 Config Map</h4>

    <p>
        It is an external configuration of the application, it contains configuration data like URLs of a database
        or some other service that the application owner used. So in Kubernetes users need to connect it to the pod
        so that pod gets the data that the config map contains <a href="#r24">[24]</a>.
    </p>

    <h4>3.1.5 Secret</h4>

    <p>
        It can be used to store secret credentials, for example, base 64 encoded format, so secrets would contain things like credentials <a href="#r24">[24]</a>. Hence, it store's confidential information like passwords and certificates.
    </p>

    <h4>3.1.6 Volumes</h4>

    <p>
        A Volume is a directory that can be accessed by a pod for containers. Kubernetes uses its own abstraction of
        volumes, allowing all containers to share data and remain available until the pod is dismantled <a
            href="#r1">[1]</a>.
    </p>

    <h4>3.1.7 Node</h4>

    <p>
        Node is the place of the machine where Kubernetes is installed either it can be a physical or virtual
        machine <a href="#r1">[1]</a>. Node is the part of a machine where Kubernetes launches its container inside
        of pods for the execution of processes.
    </p>

    <h4>3.1.8 Containers</h4>
    <p>
        Containers are self-contained, standardized execution enclosures that are composed of dependencies along
        with the binaries and libraries required to get similar behaviour wherever the user runs it <a
            href="#r1">[1]</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>3.2 Architecture of Kubernetes</h2>
    <i>Edited by Diwakar Dangal</i>

    <p>
        This section described the main architecture of Kubernetes.
    </p>

    <h3>3.2.1 Kubernetes Cluster</h3>
    <p>
        Kubernetes <a href="#r1">[1]</a> cluster at least consists of one master or multiple and several worker
        nodes. In production environments, there could be multiple masters and worker nodes to ensure the high
        availability of the cluster.
    </p>

    <h3>3.2.2 Master Node</h3>
    <p>
        In master nodes, we have completely different processes running inside, and these four processes that run on
        every master node that controls the cluster state and the worker nodes.
    </p>

    <h4>3.2.2.1 Kube-controller Manager</h4>
    <p>
        This is responsible for ensuring that the cluster is running in the desired state<a href="#r2">[2]</a>. For
        instance, 3 pods are running if one pod gets collapsed, now it's Kube-controller manager job is to create
        new replicas and carry on process execution <a href="#r2">[2,</a><a href="#r24"> 24</a><a href="#r1">,
        1]</a>.
    </p>

    <h4>3.2.2.2 Kube-scheduler</h4>
    <p>
        It decides how events and jobs will be scheduled across the cluster considering several factors including
        nodes, resources availability, and the policy set by the application owner <a href="#r2">[2</a><a
            href="#r4">, 4]</a>.
    </p>

    <h4>3.2.2.3 Kube-API Server</h4>
    <p>
        Kube-API server is like a cluster gateway that gets the initial request of any updates into the cluster or
        even the queries from the cluster. It makes sure it is an authorized request and if everything is fine then
        it will forward our request to other processes in order to schedule the pod <a href="#r2">[2]</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>3.3 System Requirement</h3>
    <i>Edited by Meshu Deb Nath</i>

    <p>
        This section described the hardware and software requirements of Kubernetes.
    </p>

    <h4>3.3.1 Hardware Requirements</h4>
    <p>
        Kubernetes cluster can be set up on a Linux based operating system such as Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, Red Hat
        Enterprise Linux, Fedora, HypriotOS, Flatcar Container Linux. This operating system should have at least 2GB
        or more RAM per machine with a minimum of 2 CPU or more. Also, Unique hostname, MAC address, and
        product_uuid are required for every node. It also requires certain ports for the operation <a
            href="#r1">[1]</a>.

    </p>

    <h4>3.3.2 Typical Node and Application Sizes</h4>
    <p>
        While creating a Kubernetes cluster choosing how many worker nodes and what type of nodes is challenging.
        The total computational capacity of the cluster (in terms of CPU and memory) is dependent on the sum of all
        the nodes of the cluster <a href="#r19">[19]</a>. There are several ways to find out the desired target
        capacity of a cluster. For example, if our application needed a cluster setup with a total capacity of 8 CPU
        cores and 32 GB of RAM. Therefore, we can design it in two possible ways such as a cluster with few large
        nodes which is 2 nodes (4 CPU and 16 GB of RAM for each).
        Another way of design is a cluster with many small nodes which is 4 nodes (2 CPU and 8 GB of RAM for each
        node) <a href="#r19">[19]</a>.

    </p>

    <p>
        The best design depends on application requirements. For example, if the application requires 10 GB of
        memory then the cluster with a few large nodes would be the best choice. Because it can be designed with
        fewer machines than many smaller nodes hence it is cost-effective. It can easily fit the resource-hungry
        application into the worker nodes. But it has some issues such as a large number of pods per node thus it
        makes the system slow. There are some reports of nodes being reported as non-ready <a href="#r20">[20]</a>.
        Therefore, Kubernetes recommend a maximum number of 110 pods per nodes <a href="#r1">[1]</a>.

    </p>
    <p>
        Alternatively, if the application requires high availability with 10-fold replication therefore, designing
        the cluster with many smaller nodes would be the best design <a href="#r19">[19]</a>. Because it can reduce
        the blast radius for example, if we have 100 pods in 10 nodes then each node will be responsible for on
        average 10 pods. Thus, if one of the nodes fails, it barely impacts the total workload. Also, many smaller
        nodes allow highly replication that means during the nodes failure scenario, there is a possibility of
        another replica maintaining the app's stability all the time. It has also some drawbacks such as pods
        limitation, lower resource utilization,
        more system overhead etc <a href="#r19">[19]</a>. So, achieving a target capacity depends on the specific
        application requirements.
    </p>

    <h3>3.4 Deployment Strategy
    </h3>
    <i>Edited by Meshu Deb Nath</i>

    <p>
        One of the biggest challenges in cloud technology is how to deploy applications more instantly and
        cost-effectively. It is important to choose the right strategy to make a reliable transition during an
        application update procedure. System availability measured by a given time limit which is a nonfunctional
        requirement <a href="#r15">[15]</a>. High availability is only achieved when the system is 99.999% available
        at the time <a href="#r16">[16]</a>. We are going to discuss four types of deployment strategies here.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Rolling Deployment: It is the standard default deployment strategy which gradually updates the pods, one
            by one and replaces pods with the newer version pods without cluster downtime <a href="#r7">[7]</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Recreate Deployment: This deployment killed all the existing pods and replaced them with new instances
            from the latest updates <a href="#r17">[17]</a>.
        </li>

        <li>
            Blue-Green Deployment: In this deployment strategy an old version referred to Green and newer version
            referred to blue get deployed simultaneously but the users only have access to the Green version <a
                href="#r17">[17]</a>.

        </li>
        <li>
            Canary Deployment: It is more similar to Blue-Green deployment but more controlled and used a
            progressive delivery phase for the deployment. It is convenient for error and performance monitoring but
            slow rollout and sometimes needs additional tools for shifting traffic, for example, Istio or Linkerd <a
                href="#r17">[17]</a>.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>4. Demonstration</h2>
    <i>Edited by Meshu Deb Nath</i>

    <p>
        We set up a Kubernetes cluster of 4 nodes, consisting of 1 master node and 4 worker nodes which has 1 core
        for each machine with 4 GB of Ram.
        (we ignored the minimum core recommendation due to resource limitation). Linux Debian Kernel version
        4.19.152-1 (2020-10-18) is the OS on all
        VMs and Docker 18.09 is running as the container engine with Kubernetes 1.15.2 is running on all nodes. For
        the demonstration,
        we use an application developed using microservice patterns. The pod deployment YAML provided to the
        deployment controller contains
        the container image of a Backend service, a Frontend Service and a MongoDB. We also define three services
        for the three pods with one as a load balancer type to make an endpoint for the outside of the cluster.

    <p>
        We created our backend microservice using express js, front-end microservice using Vue js and
        containerized these microservices using docker build <a href="#r21">[21]</a>(see <a href="#figure1">figure 1</a>). Then, we pushed
        and stored them in the Docker Hub <a href="#r20">[20]</a> (see <a href="#figure2">figure 2</a>).

    <h3>4.1 Components Overview of Our Cluster</h3>

    </figure>

    <p>
        According to <a href="#figure3">figure 3</a>, a user can access our Frontend external service via a load balancer IP address.
        Therefore, the external service of Frontend pods calls the Backend external service which can get the data
        from the MongoDB through an internal service.

    <h3>4.3 Autoscaling</h3>
    <i>Edited by Meshu Deb Nath</i>

    <p>
        One of the most important features of Kubernetes is auto-scaling. It monitors applications and services
        built with container technology without the help of human interaction. There are three auto scalers in the
        latest version of Kubernetes.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) <a href="#r1">[1]</a> handles pod adjustments more dynamically and
            powerfully by monitoring resource consumption of the applications.
        </li>
        <li>
            Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)<a href="#r1">[1]</a> instantly changes the YAML specifications, such as
            pods minimum requirement and maintains the number of working pods. Therefore, it kills the existing pods
            and thus disrupts the state of the applications and services.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cluster Autoscaler (CA) <a href="#r1">[1]</a> raises the number of nodes only when it is not possible to
            schedule pods on the existing nodes. Cluster Autoscaler only works on cloud platforms run by the
            commercial company such as Google Cloud Platform <a href="#r11">[11]</a> and Amazon Web Services <a
                href="#r1">[10]</a>.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>4.3.1 Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)</h4>
    <p>
        In Kubernetes, HPA is a great tool that automatically increases or decreases the number of pods based on the
        overall computational and processing power of the application‚Äôs without affecting the current running pods
        (see <a href="#figure10">Figure 10</a>).
        HPA is a controlled loop implemented by the controller manager. In every 15 seconds (called a sync cycle),
        the Kube controller manager compares the metrics (collected from either the resource metrics API or the
        custom metrics API) with the resource utilization <a href="#r1">[1]</a>.
    </p>

    <figure id="figure10">
        <img src="demo4.png" alt="Architecture of Kubernetes HPA"/>
        <figcaption>
            <strong>Figure 10.</strong> The Architecture of Kubernetes HPA <a href="#r12">[12]</a>.
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
        The HPA controller operates according to the algorithm in equation <a href="#equation1">(1)</a>.
    </p>
    <figure>
        <p id="equation1">
            desiredReplicas = currentReplicas * (currentMetricValue / desiredMetricValue) <a href="#r1">[1]</a> (1)
        </p>
    </figure>
    <p>
        Where desired replicas is the number of pods after autoscaling on the other side current replica defined as
        the number of pods which are currently running,
        current metric value denoted as the latest collected metric value and finally, the target threshold is defined
        as desiredMetricValue.
    </p>
    <figure id="figure11">
        <img src="demo5.png" alt="Metric Data of Demo-application"/>
        <figcaption>
            <strong>Figure 11.</strong> Metric Data of Demo-application.
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
        <a href="#figure11">Figure 11.</a> shows the configuration and metrics of our Demo application.
        Where "MINPODS" and "MAXPODS" are the requirements for the Kubernetes cluster which refer
        to the minimum and maximum number of pods. In the figure, the minimum pod‚Äôs requirement for
        the cluster is 1 and the maximum is 10. The Kube controller manager continuously tracks this
        replica set number and compares it with the above requirements. For the scaling operation,
        CPU usages are going to be used as a metric. We set a 10% threshold for the CPU usages.
        Therefore, when the application reaches the 10% threshold,
        HPA will automatically increase the number of pods according to equation <a href="#equation1">(1)</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, according to <a href="#figure11">figure 11</a>, if the current metric value is 40% and the desired value is 10%, the
        number of replicas will be (1 x (0.40 / 0.10)) or 4.
        Therefore, the Kube controller manager calls the Kube API server to create 3 more pods. If the current
        metric value declines to 20% CPU usage, then the desired replicas will be (4 x (0.20/0.10)) or 8. Therefore, 4 more pods will create. On the other side, If the current value is instead 5%, HPA will halve the
        number of replicas that means 4, since (8 x (0.05 / 0.10)) or 0.5 [2]. To normalize the metrics fluctuations, a little delay period is maintained before removing a pod from the cluster which is 5 minutes
        <a href="#r1">[1]</a>.
        HPA will stop the scaling if the ratio is adequately close to 1.0 <a href="#r1">[1]</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Furthermore, HPA can follow several metrics at a time, each of the metrics has its own threshold value.
        HPA will operate its scaling procedure when any of these metrics crosses its threshold mark <a
            href="#r2">[2]</a>.

    <h2>5. Conclusion and Research Problems</h2>
    <i>Edited by Meshu Deb Nath and Diwakar Dangal</i>

    <p>
        In this report, we have provided an overview of Kubernetes, when to use it and when not and its powerful
        feature HPA. We demonstrated a microservice application to showcase the use of Kubernetes. Unlike Kubernetes built-in
        monitoring system which only utilizes the CPU, further research can be made to take the metrics from the application
        perspective. Also, we think more deployment flexibility can be made in the future.
